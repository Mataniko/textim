SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Another tool?,כלי נוסף?
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,He must find his birthstones.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Mirth cones?!,

SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Summer is the first.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,I think I hid that one somewhere near...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,That is all I can recall.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,I summoned all your stones...,

SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Write him one to aid his quest.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Of course!,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,You'll need a...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...Magic scroll!,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,I solved the birth- stones quest...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...and I received a flute.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"Excellent, Bandon...","מצוין, ברנדון..."
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Have you practiced yet?,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,My name is Brandon sir...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...not Bandon or Cramden...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...and the flute is rather shrill.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...and I have not tried playing the flute.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Zanthia knows Alchemy...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,She could change your name.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,She lives just across Shadowland I think...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...or did she move?,

SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,A what?,מה?
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,He's had writer's block for years.,היה לו מחסום כתיבה במשך שנים.
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Perhaps the crisis has inspired him.,אולי המשבר נתן לו השראה.
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Are you saying I scattered papers about just to look busy?,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Say...,

SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...and so hard to peel!,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"So, can you help me?",
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Brynn thought so.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,If you'd just stop your dancing Cramden...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...and bring me what I asked for!,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Well Branson...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,You still have not given me the quill I need.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,For mystics with no magic left...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...you all seem to have an awful lot.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Malcolm's hold grows ever stronger...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...and soon no spells of ours will work.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"So take the scroll, and use it later.",
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"Take the scroll, Random...",
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...use it in your quests.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Brynton...,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,...solve your birthstones quest!,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Then return here.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"What are you doing back here, Burton?",
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,You must find Zanthia in Faeriewood.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"Welcome back, Branson.",
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"Hello again, Darm.",
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,You'd better get back to Faeriewood and complete your quests!,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,There is already a scroll there.,
SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,Isn't this the trophy from last year's Kyrandia Days 3-leg relay race?,
