1,This tree is too healthy to cut down.
2,I did a great job.
3,Maybe I should become a tree surgeon.
4,A thriving tree
5,WOW.WSA
6,Wow!
7,I healed the willow tree!
8,"That was amazing, Brandon!"
9,Want to play?
10,I'll show you this marble I found.
11,"Sorry, I can't play now, Merith..."
12,...but let me see that marble.
13,If you want it...
14,HERSAW1.WSA
15,"Brandon, I have your saw!"
16,"That's ok, Herman.  You can keep it."
17,But I sharpened it just for you!
18,HERSAW2.WSA
19,"Sawing logs, Herman?"
20,He won't let go of the saw.
21,A royal hallway
22,SPELL.WSA
23,BRANDYW2.WSA
24,Good.
25,You have the scroll.
26,Next you'll seek another tool.
27,Another tool?
28,He must find his birthstones.
29,Mirth cones?!
30,You mean BIRTHSTONES.
31,The seasons have their gems.
32,Place each in order on a plate...
33,...or something like that.
34,What are my birthstones...
35,...and what plate?
36,Summer is the first.
37,I think I hid that one somewhere near...
38,That is all I can recall.
39,I summoned all your stones...
40,...but my spell has gone awry.
41,You will have to choose from whatever lies about.
42,"Aha, you have my quill!"
43,Why did I want it?
44,You are the Master of Scrolls.
45,Write him one to aid his quest.
46,Of course!
47,You'll need a...
48,...Magic scroll!
49,I solved the birth- stones quest...
50,...and I received a flute.
51,"Excellent, Bandon..."
52,Have you practiced yet?
53,My name is Brandon sir...
54,...not Bandon or Cramden...
55,...and the flute is rather shrill.
56,...and I have not tried playing the flute.
57,Zanthia knows Alchemy...
58,She could change your name.
59,She lives just across Shadowland I think...
60,...or did she move?
61,Forgive him please...
62,...he tries hard.
63,The labyrinth begins at Serpent's Grotto.
64,Be very cautious!
65,There are horrible beasts in there!
66,Darm - Are you awake?
67,May I help you?
68,He asked for ME!
69,Why would he visit you?
70,What do you want boy?
71,Are you taking orders for cheese?
72,"This is Brandon, you old dolt."
73,You know...
74,Kallak's grandson...
75,The one on a quest to overthrow Malcolm's power.
76,I knew that.
77,"So, Branson, you're a dancer?"
78,That seems odd.
79,I'll need a quill.
80,A what?
81,He's had writer's block for years.
82,Perhaps the crisis has inspired him.
83,Are you saying I scattered papers about just to look busy?
84,Say...
85,Could YOU brush a dragon's teeth?
86,BRANDYW3.WSA
87,Do I smell cats on your breath?
88,Is it my fault I don't eat knights?
89,Yech!
90,All sweat and muscle...
91,...and so hard to peel!
92,"So, can you help me?"
93,Brynn thought so.
94,If you'd just stop your dancing Cramden...
95,...and bring me what I asked for!
96,Well Branson...
97,You still have not given me the quill I need.
98,For mystics with no magic left...
99,...you all seem to have an awful lot.
100,Malcolm's hold grows ever stronger...
101,...and soon no spells of ours will work.
102,"So take the scroll, and use it later."
103,"Take the scroll, Random..."
104,...use it in your quests.
105,Brynton...
106,...solve your birthstones quest!
107,Then return here.
108,"What are you doing back here, Burton?"
109,You must find Zanthia in Faeriewood.
110,"Welcome back, Branson."
111,"Hello again, Darm."
112,You'd better get back to Faeriewood and complete your quests!
113,There is already a scroll there.
114,Isn't this the trophy from last year's Kyrandia Days 3-leg relay race?
115,I carried him.
116,Don't touch those.
117,He'll have a fit if he sees you.

128,"Ha, I'd like to see the gophers try to get to my flowers now."
129,My old sandbox makes a great planter.
130,At least I won't have to wash the windows today.
131,"Nice, big sign..."
132,...but I guess we should have used the boards to make a front door.
133,I'll leave this on.
134,I don't suppose the moths will annoy him now.
135,Outside Brandon's home
136,LIFTUP.WSA
137,Hmm - I think I can almost see the castle from here.
138,What a view!

152,Were there none to test me better?
153,Do you believe in all Brynn's lies?
154,Perhaps your MOTHER should assist you.
155,"My mother is dead, sir."
156,"But YOURS lives, for surely, SHE has dressed you!"
157,"Be careful, boy.  Do not insult a man with knives."
158,Please move aside. I seek the cave.
159,"Beware, young fool..."
160,...my grip may slip!
161,DODGE.WSA
162,No bother sir. You missed the mark.
163,I do not miss...
164,...except at will.
165,"I must return your gift, kind sir."
166,"I leave you now, and dodge your sorrow..."
167,...but I may NOT be nice tomorrow.

172,Serpent's Grotto
173,Don't you want this?
174,It's the closest thing to birdseed I've got.
175,Why would a sick bird want that?
176,That bird is definitely hurt...
177,How can his wing bend like that?
178,Yeech!
179,What a messy housekeeper.

200,You must be Brandon.
201,You were a child the last time I saw you.
202,"So, what's in the cauldron?"
203,A potion for time travel?
204,"No, this is my laundry."
205,Oh!
206,Did Darm and Brynn at least get all the gems activated on your amulet?
207,I have two.
208,Two!?
209,Probably Healing and Will-O-Wisp!
210,They said they didn't have much magic left.
211,Nobody has much magic left!
212,Can you help me?
213,Why don't you just go up to the castle and give it a try with what you've got?
214,Fine with me.
215,"I'll go, but how will I get there?"
216,Didn't Darm do anything?
217,He recommended I come see you.
218,"Okay, I'll give you what I can, but I don't care if you are the Prince..."
219,...I'm not giving up my wardrobe spell or my enchanted aquarium!
220,The Prince?
221,Who's a Prince?
222,THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU!!??
223,I can't believe they would do this!
224,"Listen Brandon, we're in trouble."
225,Go to the Enchanted Fountain...
226,...and fill a flask for me.
227,I'll get things set up for your potions.
228,"The fountain is ruined, and there is no water."
229,Malcolm was there.
230,"Let me explain, Brandon."
231,"Without magic water, none of my potions are possible."
232,This cauldron can mix up potions that when combined will give the ability to fly to the castle.
233,"But you need the water, right?"
234,I'll find some.
235,Maybe some splashed out...
236,...or I can wring some out of the moss.
237,Now what's this about a Prince?
238,Bring the magic water from the fountain first...
239,...and then we'll talk.
240,"Thanks, Brandon..."
241,You are a Prince.
242,THE Prince actually.
243,Your parents were King William and Queen Katherine...
244,Did you know Malcolm murdered them and seized the Kyragem?
245,We had him locked in the castle.  But now he's loose.
246,Malcolm!
247,That old jester?
248,"If I free the gem, can I get revenge?"
249,Will it give me powers?
250,It will be difficult.
251,I'm sure the vestments have been lost.
252,Malcolm probably wears the crown.
253,"You'll need luck, if nothing else."
254,Are you Mystics powerless?
255,Can't you free the Kyragem?
256,Only you can do it now.
257,The pact requires royal blood.
258,What should I do?
259,Let's mix a potion.
260,Go get some blueberries.
261,CARPET.WSA
262,"It looks thick, like blue syrup."
263,This one looks dangerous.
264,"A beautiful color, but what is it?"
265,Why would I want her laundry water?
266,The concoction seems to be only half-complete.
267,It smells like a strange combination of herbs and spices.
268,This flask is already filled.
269,I only use the freshest ingredients!
270,Go get some fresh blueberries!
271,This doesn't look like a blueberry!
272,Hey!
273,Rats. I wish I could find one of her cookbooks.
274,Fetch the magic water.
275,Then we'll worry about ingredients.
276,These blueberries are not freshly picked.
277,I need fresh blueberries!
278,This doesn't look like a blueberry
279,Are you a donkey?
280,Go get the magic water!
281,We need the magic water Brandon.
282,Did you bring it?
283,What's this?  A cellar?
284,ZANDOORD.WSA
285,Ow!  That's hot!
286,Zanthia's laboratory
287,ZANDOORU.WSA
288,A cavernous entrance
289,A beautiful tulip.
290,These look better than my garden.
291,I've always loved tulips.
292,I can't stop myself.
293,I wonder if there's fish back under the ground?
294,I'd hate to lose this in the spring.
295,Someone should bottle this water and sell it!
296,Quite a flow for such a small spring.
297,Wonderful...
298,...it's beautiful.
299,That big rock on the bottom looks pretty.
300,I wish I had time to soak my feet.
301,A southern cliff
302,This window looks great at night when the temple candles are lit.
303,That must be Brynn's mother.
304,The Temple of Kyrandia
305,She wants me to get flowers?!
306,Grandfather is a rock!
307,"He needs help, not sympathy!"
308,A tall cliff
309,Hey!  No more dent.
310,What's this?  A big dent?
311,Hey!
312,The teardrop fits!
313,I would never cut this tree down!
314,Ugh!
315,Even the trunk is rotten.
316,"Boy, this willow needs help."
317,A rotting tree
318,What happened?
319,This willow looks half dead!
320,I wonder if that Malcolm made this tree sick?
321,Ugh.  Something sticky is oozing out.
322,This is the first time I've ever seen Darm standing up.
323,"He didn't get Brandywine too, did he?"
324,It looks SO comfortable.
325,It doesn't look like Darm had many things.
326,I have nothing to light this with.
327,Darm's unintelligible notes.
328,Everything looks dead out there.
329,I don't have time to sit and rest.
330,A bedroom
331,You're the Mystic...
332,...But I'll give it try...
333,The sawdust smells great!
334,AARGH!
335,"The bridge looks ruined, Herman."
336,Huh?
337,Aren't you going to fix it?
338,"Sure, but I don't know how!"
339,I meant to replace the bad planks but you know how time flies by.
340,I hope nobody important tried to cross.
341,I could lose my job.
342,Can't you just get some new planks and rope?
343,NEEDSAW1.WSA
344,I can get new rope.
345,I just need to cut new planks!
346,But I don't have anything to cut them with.
347,I'll see what I can do.
348,Sure.
349,I'll get to work on cutting some wood for new planks.
350,I hope he doesn't cut his leg off!
351,That's a pretty old saw.
352,It's the only musical instrument Grandfather knows how to play.
353,"Uh, yeah..."
354,"Well, I guess I'll try to cut some new planks."
355,"Thanks, Herman."
356,I wonder if I can find something that will help him fix the bridge.
357,I don't think that will help him fix the bridge.
358,I wonder if I can make it across to the other side?
359,That rope does look pretty chancy...
360,...but I'll TAKE that chance!
361,AGILE.WSA
362,BALANCE2.WSA
363,"Better to play it safe, I guess..."
364,But I still think I could have made it.
365,"You know, Herman..."
366,I think I can make it across.
367,I dunno Brandon.
368,ADVICE.WSA
369,All that's left is that thin rope...
370,...and even that looks like it's about to go.
371,Nonsense!
372,You're not saying I'm clumsy are you?
373,"I am quite agile, Herman!"
374,"I'm in charge here, and if anything happened to you, I'd get blamed!"
375,Hmm...
376,"I'm gonna try it, Herman!"
377,Wait!
378,At least let me get close so that if you fall in--
379,Here I go!
380,Oh No!
381,Now they'll MAKE me fix the bridge!
382,I guess I'll play it safe...
383,"Thanks, Brandon."
384,A ruined bridge
385,It wasn't my fault!
386,*COUGH*
387,*COUGH*
388,"Good morning, Nolby."
389,*HACK*
390,*WHEEZE*
391,I'm busy.
392,Go away.
393,Go pester the Mystic.
394,"Enlighten Darm with your presence, not me."
395,Your mumbling distracts me.
396,Please leave and go.
397,"I need a quill, sir."
398,Can you direct me?
399,What for?
400,*ACKACKACK*
401,Darm requests it.
402,I am collecting magic to fight Malcolm.
403,I know of Malcolm.
404,He scares the birds.
405,"There is one songbird left, but..."
406,It is hurt and cannot sing.
407,I'm sorry to hear that.
408,But I still need a quill.
409,"If you would harvest, you must sow!"
410,*WHEEZE*
411,Are these my new shoes?
412,Excuse me.
413,*COUGH* Harvest!
414,Can't you see I'm trying to rest?
415,I tried to carve my name on this...
416,...but Nolby has been here forever.
417,Why do birds need baths?
418,I've never seen a muddy bird.
419,Cheep Cheep
420,Is that bird ALWAYS here?
421,The oldest tree in Kyrandia
422,I'd love to sit down...
423,I see now.
424,That's impressive!
425,This is not fair!
426,I'm getting tired of this!
427,Why am I doing this?
428,This is depressing.
429,What do I have to do?
430,I see now.
431,There we go!
432,What's so hard about that?
433,All right!
434,I placed the second correct gemstone!
435,I placed the third correct gemstone!
436,Yes!
437,I placed the last gemstone...
438,...I've finished the quest!
439,ALTER.WSA
440,Oh!
441,What's that?
442,Nice work.  Very professional.
443,It feels like some unseen force is pulling my gemstone toward the gold dish.
444,What am I?  A masonry inspector?
445,How do they get this so smooth?
446,Hmm?  It's being pushed away!
447,A flute?
448,Watch out Malcolm!
449,I'm coming to get you and I've got a flute now!
450,The magical dish is now gone.
451,A golden dish.
452,Any porridge left in there?
453,It vanished in a burst of flames!
454,Hmm.  This must be finished.
455,It is being pushed away from the dish by some unseen force.
456,A marble altar
457,This must be the Kyragem!
458,A mirror -- I can see myself.
459,A mirror.
460,Now I think he's really mad!
461,A tall cliff
462,Dark forest
463,"Over here, slow-poke!"
464,FOUNTAN1.WSA
465,FTNTALK.WSA
466,Ahoy there matey.
467,How goes your quest?
468,I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
469,Are you ready now?
470,Shall we joust?
471,At this moment I only seek water from the fountain.
472,What a shame!
473,My finger bath is boring now...
474,...and I MUST have some fun.
475,Perhaps some hide and seek will amuse us both.
476,"If you need water, you'll have to fix the fountain first."
477,I cannot tell you where to look.
478,For that is neither fair nor fun!
479,FOUNTAN2.WSA
480,HA HA HA
481,The water is sparkling.
482,If I get these shoes wet I'll never make it to the castle.
483,This flask is already filled.
484,Hmm.  Worth a try.
485,I wonder if she knows she's spilling?
486,The Enchanted Fountain
487,Rats!  I'd like to pry one of these off!
488,The Cavern of Twilight
489,Ahh!
490,Can I cut you out?
491,"Uh-Oh, maybe these teeth can be repaired."
492,It was worth a try.
493,I'll have this fixed.
494,Rocks.
495,Several rocks.
496,Why do I keep touching this?
497,How can these help?

501,Brandon?
502,What?
503,Who said that?
504,"Are you Brandon, grandson of Kallak?"
505,I am.
506,What are you?
507,We are of the Other Kingdom.
508,We speak for the Land.
509,Why would the Land speak to me?
510,"We are dying, Brandon."
511,Magic spells of an evil intent have upset the balance of nature.
512,Can't you use your magic to fight this evil?
513,Evil exists only in the Kingdom of Man.
514,The Land has no evil...
515,"...and thus, no defense against it."
516,But-- why is this happening now?
517,"The magic Kyragem, symbol of the trust between our kingdoms, has been corrupted."
518,"Now, it can no longer protect us."
519,"You, Brandon, must oppose on our behalf."
520,What!?
521,Why me?
522,"You have been chosen, Grandson of Kallak."
523,Your destiny was forged before your birth.
524,But I wouldn't know where to start.
525,"Let your faith guide you, Brandon."
526,Prepare for your journey.
527,Wait!
528,What about--
529,TOUCH.WSA
530,What happened to my Grandfather?
531,Anything else in here?
532,I thought my sandals were in here.
533,An apple!
534,Hello again.
535,It fell into the vase!
536,I think there's already something in there.
537,The tree was right.
538,The land IS dying.
539,I can see plenty of dead trees from here.
540,"Brynn, Brynn!"
541,Come quick!
542,Guess she didn't hear me.
543,I'll have to go get her.
544,Should I lay Grandfather on the bed?
545,I don't think there's any way to move him.
546,"I can't take this, he'll need the light."
547,The Mystic Book Club.
548,"Nice covers, but lousy reading."
549,Grandfather's saw.
550,I don't want to carry this around!
551,I don't think he can chew.
552,GRANDPA.WSA
553,"Grandfather, can you hear me?"
554,A note.
555,Anything in here?
556,Brandon's home
557,Grandfather!
558,What happened to you?!?
559,Perhaps my magic can heal Grandfather...
560,I'm sorry Grandfather...
561,Another big sign...
562,...but no front door.
563,I should plant one of these in our yard.
564,"Is this thatch, or just weeds thrown on the roof?"
565,A strange hut
566,Hello--
567,Anybody home?
568,"(Boy, it's dark in here.)"
569,Darm?
570,I told you...
571,Bring me something good and I'll trade for the chalice.
572,"Fine, I'll play your little game."
573,"How about a big, juicy apple?"
574,Now that sounds GOOD!
575,I'm not tall enough to pick apples!
576,"Well, where did you hide my chalice?"
577,"I hid MY chalice outside, you big oaf."
578,Go outside and take a look.
579,How about a blueberry?
580,"Blueberries are okay, but I eat them all the time."
581,"Since I'm so small, they're easy to pick."
582,How about this?
583,That's obviously a fake...
584,...too big to be real.
585,How about this?
586,"No, I said I want something good."
587,I don't need anything else from you.
588,Go outside and look for the chalice.
589,You'll find it.
590,"No, forget it..."
591,I don't want it back.
592,Just take it and go.
593,I don't need anything else from you...
594,I've given you my chalice...
595,My only prize posession...
596,Just go now.
597,JUMP.WSA
598,Ever thought of putting in some stairs?
599,LEPCLIMB.WSA
600,Inside a tiny dwelling
601,LEPHOLE.WSA
602,You have my chalice!
603,I have MY chalice.
604,"No, it's mine!"
605,"Yes, it's MINE."
606,Why would you want it?
607,It would make your other furnishings look bad by comparison.
608,"By the way, where is my chalice?"
609,I have hidden it in a very safe place.
610,Give me something good and I'll give it to you.
611,Wow!
612,This is incredible!
613,It's huge!
614,SLIDE1.WSA
615,Welcome Lad!
616,SLIDE2.WSA
617,I see you got passed my puppies!
618,You must be VERY clever!
619,"But since you've made it, you'll have to stay."
620,You will not be able to leave this island.
621,I have but 2 rules here in my home:
622,Do not disturb my morning naps...
623,...and enter not the Kyra-vault!
624,Move aside you purple windbag!
625,"Now, now.  I've been patient..."
626,Can we not continue?
627,"Oh, and yes!"
628,A friend of yours now serves me here.
629,Oh Herman... Herman... Brandon is here!
630,Hmmm?  I don't know where he is...
631,...but I'm sure that he'll find you.
632,He really wants to return your saw.
633,Ha Ha Ha
634,What a fool!
635,I can't wait to smack him!
636,Boy!  Big stairs.
637,I wonder where they go?
638,I keep expecting banana peels here.
639,Here I go again!
640,UPSTAIRS.WSA
641,Castle entry hall
642,This heat is pretty intense...
643,...but I know I can take it!
644,BRANBRN.WSA
645,Not a problem...
646,I'm burning!
647,"A subterranean, volcanic river"
648,(Hmm...)
649,"(Thought I'd sneak around the other way, huh?)"
650,TAG-0.WSA
651,TAG.WSA
652,"Let go of the branch, Merith."
653,I'll catch you.
654,"Very funny, Brandon."
655,You can have the marble!
656,I'm not playing with you anymore!
657,"Thanks, Merith."
658,Dark forest
659,"Over here, slow-poke!"
660,I'm NOT chasing you!
661,Aaugh--
662,Great--
663,Ow !  I hope this is what Brynn wants.
664,Ow!
665,Nasty thorns!
666,I'll take a whole bouquet.
667,I already picked the rose that used to be there.
668,Is it missing a piece?
669,That fits tight even without glue!
670,Hey!  Perfect fit!
671,Must be fixed now!
672,Is it broken?
673,The altar radiates an intense magic.
674,Wow!
675,That must be the amulet!
676,"Hey, this is going to be easy!"
677,This altar used to glow with magic.
678,Hmm.  It's humming.
679,It certainly has a healthy glow!
680,Looks like some kind of magical force field.
681,This has to fit something.
682,Nothing else in there.
683,"A dank, dungeon passage"
684,This might work.
685,Dark forest
686,SAW.WSA
687,Almost finished?
688,Why don't you go visit Brynn in the temple?
689,"Oh, so now you're in a hurry."
690,"If you watch, it's going to cost you extra."
691,"I'd let you help, but I don't like to loan tools."
692,"Well, this saw of yours could use a sharpening."
693,Don't you have something else to do?
694,It's still gonna take a while to get through this tree.
695,"Okay, I'll come back later."
696,Brynn... I always took her for granite.
697,She was always so kind to me.
698,Looks like it might storm pretty soon.
699,I can't think of sleep at a time like this.
700,"Judging by the decor, this must have been Brynn's bedroom."
701,A bedroom
702,I'll try this on you Brynn...
703,This is a fancy poker!
704,Now that's a knife!
705,Look's like they're filled with dust.
706,I wouldn't dare drink anything from that!
707,This looks vicious!
708,What a pig!
709,Anything in here?
710,Hmm.  Nothing!
711,This place sure has a strange floorplan!
712,I'm not jumping all the way down there!
713,The Great Hall
714,LEP_OUT.WSA
715,"Finally, somebody has a front door."
716,"Hey, Pipsqueak!"
717,Are you in there?
718,That troublesome little Faun lives in there.
719,Was that a pack-rat?
720,Hmm?
721,WILOFISH.WSA
722,That's exotic.
723,Solid gold!
724,Somebody's rich.
725,Wish I knew how to swim.
726,Is that where the castle is?
727,A tropical lagoon
728,CTRAP1.WSA
729,Whoa!  Someone hid this inside the stump!
730,I guess there's nothing else in there.
731,A strange stump
732,CTRAP2.WSA
733,"Hello, hello?"
734,DROPUP.WSA
735,Below Brandon's home
736,DROPDOWN.WSA
737,Can't you move any faster?
738,RIDGE.WSA
739,A high bluff
740,Crystal Ball taken.
741,Ha!  Does he think I'm stupid?
742,Now I have the Crystal Ball.
743,Ow!  Thats hot!
744,Rats!  And me with no hot-dogs.
745,Ow!
746,A flaming tree
747,A rocky outcropping
748,The Timbermist Woods
749,A cavernous entrance
750,Uh oh!
751,I think I'm in trouble now!
752,I'd like to find this Malcolm.
753,Blueberries.
754,A dark island
755,LANDING.WSA
756,Oh! That was wild!
757,Whoops...
758,At last you've come!
759,I have been waiting for so long!
760,Can you take me with you?
761,Please ignore her.
762,She cannot think clearly.
763,I am glad to see you and would like to go with you when you leave.
764,We both can't go!
765,Well I'm not staying!
766,I hate it here!
767,I have been here longer.
768,I should leave first.
769,We came together!
770,"You will recall, I entered first."
771,You were taunting shadow wraiths.
772,One of us must stay...
773,...until the altar is completed.
774,Why don't you finish it yourselves...
775,...and then you both could leave?
776,We serve the Master of Tides and Love.
777,We are not craftsmen!
778,"But YOU could do it, though."
779,And then we all could go!
780,What needs to be done?
781,We don't know.
782,"WE only know how to float, and we could teach you."
783,If I can think of what to do...
784,...I will return.
785,MOONCAV1.WSA
786,MOONCAV2.WSA
787,The moonstone fits...
788,I'm brilliant!
789,The whole place is lit up with moonlight!
790,Thank you! Thank you!
791,And now as we promised...
792,I feel strange...
793,One of the gems on my amulet is now glowing purple!
794,Is something missing here?
795,I'll bet something fits in there...
796,...but this is not it.
797,I already put one here.
798,The moonstone is locked in place.
799,There is already a moonstone there.
800,A cavern of emeralds
801,Wow! The walls are made of emerald!
802,Fireberries...
803,Maybe these will help me find my way in the dark.
804,A fireberry bush
805,"A dark, mysterious cavern"
806,I can't see a thing in here!
807,EYES.WSA
808,Uh oh...
809,Hello?
810,Hello?  Anybody down there?
811,I wonder if my green hat is still down there?
812,The well is now filled with fresh water!
813,Something's happening down there...
814,Huh!?
815,A Moonstone!
816,I wish I hadn't done that.
817,Oops.  I hope I don't need that later.
818,Looks like Herman fixed this.
819,There's my initials right on the side there.
820,I carved them there myself!
821,Dark forest
822,CAVEDOOR.WSA
823,ROCKS1.WSA
824,Made it first shot!
825,Looks like I'll need to toss in more rocks.
826,ROCKS2.WSA
827,Made it again!
828,"It must need more rocks, though."
829,ROCKS3.WSA
830,Yes!
831,This is too easy!
832,ROCKS4.WSA
833,Oops...
834,ROCKS5.WSA
835,I did it!
836,I can get back outside.
837,That looks like Grandfathers.
838,I don't think that this is heavy enough to counteract that hanging weight.
839,TRAPPED.WSA
840,Oh now that's just great.
841,The iron grate must be attached to the dish and counterweight mechanism.
842,That torch is bolted in place.
843,BRYNN1.WSA
844,I found a note on his bench.
845,It's marked with your name...
846,...but the rest is blank!
847,May I see it?
848,"Brynn, Grandfather is hurt!"
849,"What happened, Brandon?"
850,He has been turned to stone!
851,I don't know how it happened!
852,Perhaps there is a clue at your home.
853,This is an enchanted message.
854,I will remove the spell.
855,"Brandon, you should read this"
856,BRYNN2.WSA
857,Amulet...Lavender Rose?  What does this mean?
858,"If Malcolm has escaped,"
859,He'll use his spiteful magic to destroy Kyrandia.
860,Can't YOUR magic stop him?
861,It will take all that we can gather to match Malcolm.
862,What about Grandfather?
863,"I am sorry, Brandon."
864,Noble Kallak can only be saved by defeating Malcolm.
865,What can we do?
866,We are not helpless.
867,Find a lavender rose for me...
868,...and I shall create an enchantment to help you.
869,What about--
870,"Hurry, Brandon."
871,Each passing minute dilutes our strength.
872,BRYNN3.WSA
873,"Very good, Brandon."
874,Use the rose wisely and the royal amulet will be yours.
875,Amulet?
876,"In time, it will enable you to wield great power."
877,Wow!
878,Is that for me?
879,In order to obtain the amulet...
880,...you must place this rose upon the silver altar.
881,Then you must find Darm.  He lives in the Timbermist Woods.
882,He may be able to help you.
883,Good luck Brandon...
884,...and be careful.
885,BRINENTR.WSA
886,"Please show me the note, Brandon."
887,This is not what we are looking for.
888,Maybe there is a better clue.
889,"Did you find a clue, Brandon?"
890,Brandon...
891,Please bring me a lavender rose.
892,You must place your silver rose on the silver altar.
893,Dance of the Mystics
894,The Kyrandian Royal Chalice
895,The Ancient Kyr-Pot
896,I'll bet this incense burner is why Brynn always smells so good.
897,"Oops, sorry..."
898,I thought that was a spitoon.
899,"Hmm, no donations accepted I guess."
900,"Boy, this floor sure is slippery."
901,Inside the Temple
902,Have you brought me the note?
903,"Did you bring the lavender rose, Brandon?"
904,"Did you get the amulet already, Brandon?"
905,"Greetings, Brandon."
906,"Welcome, Brandon."
907,Hey Brynn!
908,I got the amulet!
909,Brynn!?
910,Brynn!!!
911,I think I like it better inside.
912,Looks like alot of Zanthia's useless stuff.
913,I think this must have been Zanthia's bedroom.
914,A bedroom
915,A rickety bridge
916,Hey!
917,"You fixed the bridge, Herman!"
918,It's completely safe now!
919,"Uh, yeah..."
920,It looks...
921,...definitely rebuilt!
922,"Thanks, Brandon."
923,So where's my saw?
924,Well...I...uh...didn't know you'd want it back.
925,"But, I'll go find it right away!"
926,"Hmm, don't these usually fall off when they're ripe?"
927,The acorn that was here has been picked.
928,Dark forest
929,How'd he do that?
930,Aren't there any easy parts?
931,A ruined fountain
932,That emerald is really wedged in there.
933,You'd think there'd be some birds on this.
934,This looks like an old mystic.
935,Doesn't look like Malcolm is bothering the Kyrandian Garden Club.
936,ACIDGATE.WSA
937,"Oh, no!"
938,Oh!  NO!
939,GATE.WSA
940,This obviously needs a key.
941,The gate is now unlocked.
942,This key doesn't fit this keyhole.
943,"Thanks, Mom!"
944,The key fit...
945,...but did it work?
946,Let's try this.
947,Here goes...
948,I feel kind of strange...
949,PEGASUS.WSA
950,There's nothing I can do with it when I'm like this.
951,"Hmm?  Blank, except it has Brynn's name on it!"
952,I'd better go to the temple.
953,Brynn will know what to do!
954,(sniff)
955,Smells like a rose to me.
956,Yum!  A small snack is nice.
957,Yuck!  Medevial sushi.
958,Tastes like alfalfa...
959,...but I like it!
960,-gulp-
961,Ahhh...
962,*COUGH*
963,*COUGH*
964,Yuck! It's salt water!
965,Ooh.  That tingles.
966,"Hey, one of the jewels on my amulet is blue now!"
967,*Hiccup*
968,*Hiccup*
969,*Hiccup*
970,I think they're gone.
971,Yecch!  Tastes like furniture polish!
972,Oh no!
973,Not again!
974,Yum!  It's warm and spicy!
975,Time for a little visit.
976,This potion should help me get in there.
977,LEP_IN.WSA
978,"Hey, that was fun!"
979,Ow!
980,This gold coin is ENORMOUS!
981,I caught this teardrop at the Pool of Sorrow.
982,I caught this teardrop by this pool.
983,A nice addition to my marble colection.
984,Delicious!  I hope they aren't poisonous.
985,SHATTER.WSA
986,Great!
987,That last note shattered the ice!
988,I didn't think my playing was THAT bad.
989,Let's try this.
990,I did it!
991,I made the flames go out!
992,I guess I'll give it a shot...
993,It worked!
994,This scroll is starting to pay off!
995,Brrr!
996,"Hmm.  Nothing happened, but I feel like going somewhere else."
997,I thought this was a dead starfish.
998,A garnet this big must be very valuable.
999,Oooh!  Purple sparkles!
1000,It's shaped like a perfect triangle.
1001,This diamond glitters in the sunlight.
1002,This emerald is my favorite color.
1003,This pearl must have come from the sea.
1004,It was dangerous getting this ruby.
1005,"Hmm,  isn't this Di Magno Ferro, Sil Quad Oxylate?"
1006,Hmm?  A corundum conundrum!
1007,What a curious combination of colors.
1008,Looks like a huge cough drop.
1009,This is the darkest gem I have ever seen.
1010,This stone is warm to the touch.
1011,This jewel glows with its own inner-light.
1012,This rare gem has a tiny rainbow inside it.
1013,Smells wonderful!
1014,"A rare, exotic flower."
1015,"Oh look, it's got half a worm in it."
1016,This rose tingles in my hand.
1017,I'd like to keep this!
1018,This looks important!
1019,"Oh, no!  Pitch!"
1020,I think I'm going nuts.
1021,I wonder what a floornut tastes like?
1022,It's glowing very bright!
1023,It's getting dimmer.
1024,"Oh, no!  It's real dim!"
1025,"Uh, oh!  It's almost out!"
1026,Help!!
1027,No more meat.
1028,I love these!
1029,Could this be carved from emerald?
1030,That tickles!
1031,Obviously a magical orb.
1032,This feels like a watermelon.
1033,What time IS it?
1034,Where does this go?
1035,What am I thinking?  It's empty!
1036,Nothing in it.
1037,This thing is heavy.
1038,This is way too big for my head!
1039,Obviously an item of royalty.
1040,This probably isn't to the restroom!
1041,Pretty tasty! I was getting hungry.
1042,No more meat left on this.
1043,"Sniff, sniff."
1044,It feels like I'm completely weightless.
1045,Why do I have to do everything?
1046,I wish I had a horse to ride.
1047,I can't believe they let this happen!
1048,Too bad I can't take a quick nap!
1049,I think I'm getting a rash!
1050,Where is everybody?
1051,You'd think somebody would have a map of this place!
1052,It seems like these caverns go on forever.
1053,Eeeu!  I got pitch all over my vest!
1054,How am I supposed to know what to do!?
1055,I'm starving!  I never did get lunch!
1056,Who would notice if I just went home?
1057,My feet are killing me!
1058,I'd do anything for a pair of sandals!
1059,PUNCH1.WSA

1062,"My, you are clever!"
1063,What gall you show to break my rule!
1064,Do you wish to fight me now?
1065,Or will you heed your mommy's plea?
1066,Did your Grandpa knit that vest?
1067,"Don't push, old man!"
1068,I'm warning you!
1069,"You're warning ME? At last, a joke!"
1070,"Move aside, I'm going in!"
1071,"I told you no, but still you must?"
1072,Don't push again old man!
1073,An ultimatum?
1074,Here's the push!
1075,Jerk.
1076,There's no more room on the pillow.
1077,I hope this is the correct spot to lay the sceptre.
1078,I wonder if this is where the crown belongs?
1079,I think the chalice probably belongs on this pillow.
1080,Red velvet!
1081,That should do it...
1082,FOYER.WSA
1083,Excellent!
1084,All the royal vestments are placed...
1085,...but are they in the correct order?
1086,Wish I had a sledge-hammer!
1087,"Of course, it's locked too!"
1088,This must be the Kyra-Vault!
1089,A rocky wall
1090,I already put a potion in there.
1091,MIXROX.WSA
1092,That's impressive!
1093,That seemed to do something.
1094,There's nothing in here.
1095,It's absorbed within the crystal.
1096,I don't think an empty vial will work here.
1097,Nothing happened.
1098,Hmm.  That's no help.
1099,I doubt an empty vial will work here.
1100,It's shape doesn't match the engraving.

1107,Hopefully she can be restored too.
1108,Looks like it might storm.
1109,Too bad I can't light this.
1110,Could that be Grandfather?
1111,This could have been Grandfather's room...
1112,...or Zanthia's.
1113,A gold key!
1114,There is nothing else hidden behind the portrait.

1123,Ow!
1124,Ow! That snake bit me!
1125,"Hmm, where is he now?"
1126,Oh great...

1162,You will require the Royal Chalice...
1163,...and this...
1164,You have my gift.
1165,It is all I can give.
1166,Be brave my son...
1167,...and use your magic wisely.
1168,William and Katherine
1169,"Hello Mother, Father."
1170,I wish I could do something to honor their memory.
1171,"Goodbye, Mother."
1172,I think one flower was enough.
1173,I don't think I should use this to pay my respects.
1174,I don't want to put anything else on their graves.
1175,A misty grave
1176,Oh no!!!
1177,I can't get to the upper level from here.
1178,"Hmm.  Well, that did something, but they're still locked!"
1179,Aha!  Unlocked at last!
1180,"Hmm.  These doors look important, but they're locked!"
1181,The great hall
1182,Where are these tears coming from?
1183,Is this whole pool filled with tears?
1184,"Sort of disgusting, actually."
1185,I wouldn't drink it on a bet.
1186,I bet I can catch a teardrop!
1187,Can I catch another one?
1188,RAINDROP.WSA
1189,Got one!
1190,That water must be salty!
1191,Nothing sinks!
1192,Pool of Sorrow
1193,Dark forest
1194,There must be a way to get across.
1195,I can't get across in my present form.
1196,I can't get back across in my present form.
1197,PLANT.WSA
1198,PLANT2.WSA
1199,I wonder what sort of fertilizer would be best?
1200,"Hey, something's happening!"
1201,"Wow, did I do this?"
1202,Good morning.
1203,Hello.
1204,Are you a nut tree or what?
1205,If you must know...
1206,...I am a Pseudobushia hugiflora!
1207,You don't happen to have any manure...
1208,...or a couple of old fish?
1209,...I'm ravenous!
1210,Sorry.
1211,That's okay.
1212,I'll get my roots going...
1213,"Hey roots, wake up!"
1214,Time to go to work!
1215,I'm starving up here!
1216,Aren't you going to give me something?
1217,According to the PSEUDOBUSHIA manual...
1218,...I am instructed to:
1219,"Thank you for ""Restoring Life to the Deadwood Glade""..."
1220,"...and to ""express our Appreciation""..."
1221,"...and so forth, and so on..."
1222,"...and ""In Token of which"", I dust you now."
1223,-cough-
1224,-cough-
1225,You got it in my nose!
1226,I feel different!
1227,"Am I stronger now, or what?"
1228,I suppose that's up to you.
1229,"I've done my part, so if you don't mind..."
1230,I'll get back to my own problems.
1231,"Come on, Roots!"
1232,Let's get going...
1233,Wow!
1234,Did I do that?
1235,I hope this is right.
1236,Doesn't look like a promising spot to start a new garden..
1237,Should I soak these seeds overnight before planting?
1238,Here goes...
1239,I already planted a pinecone.
1240,I already planted an acorn.
1241,I already planted a walnut.
1242,Looks deep!
1243,It has to be as big as a dog!
1244,"I know there are seeds in here, but I want to eat it."
1245,"This is garbage, not horticulture."
1246,I'd better not drop it in the hole.
1247,"It may come in handy, later."
1248,Good luck Mr. Bush.
1249,I think you'll need it in THIS neighborhood.
1250,Deadwood Glade
1251,That doesn't look like fun!
1252,A grand balcony
1253,A natural mineral pool
1254,Where have all the seals gone?
1255,I'd rather be fishing I suppose.
1256,That surf looks rough today!
1257,A rocky wall
1258,CHALICE1.WSA
1259,CHALICE2.WSA
1260,It's stuck.
1261,That's spooky!
1262,What holds it there?
1263,Dark forest
1264,What's the Royal Chalice doing here?
1265,Something strange is happening here!
1266,I think I'm getting a rash.
1267,I'd swear some of these trees look just like the ones in our backyard!
1268,I'll try it on the chalice.
1269,STEAL1.WSA
1270,Hey!
1271,Bring that back!
1272,Aaugh...
1273,Great...
1274,Fireberries...
1275,Maybe these will help me find my way in the dark.
1276,A fireberry bush
1277,"A dark, mysterious cavern"
1278,I can't see a thing in here!
1279,EYES.WSA
1280,Uh oh...
1281,Hello?
1282,A rocky outcropping
1283,A cavernous entrance
