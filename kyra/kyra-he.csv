Summer is the first.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,

That is all I can recall.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
I summoned all your stones...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,

You will have to choose from whatever lies about.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"Aha, you have my quill!",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
Why did I want it?,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,

You'll need a...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,

I solved the birth- stones quest...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
...and I received a flute.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"Excellent, Bandon...",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,"מצוין, ברנדון..."
Have you practiced yet?,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
My name is Brandon sir...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,

...and the flute is rather shrill.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
...and I have not tried playing the flute.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
Zanthia knows Alchemy...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
She could change your name.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
She lives just across Shadowland I think...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,

That seems odd.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
I'll need a quill.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,אני צריך קולמוס.
A what?,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,מה?
He's had writer's block for years.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,היה לו מחסום כתיבה במשך שנים.
Perhaps the crisis has inspired him.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,אולי המשבר נתן לו השראה.

Well Branson...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
You still have not given me the quill I need.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
For mystics with no magic left...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
...you all seem to have an awful lot.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
Malcolm's hold grows ever stronger...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
...and soon no spells of ours will work.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"So take the scroll, and use it later.",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"Take the scroll, Random...",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
...use it in your quests.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
Brynton...,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
...solve your birthstones quest!,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
Then return here.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"What are you doing back here, Burton?",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
You must find Zanthia in Faeriewood.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"Welcome back, Branson.",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
"Hello again, Darm.",SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
You'd better get back to Faeriewood and complete your quests!,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
There is already a scroll there.,SPELL.PAK\SPELL.EMC,
